# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

This is supporting code for the final project for Introduction to Optimization (CS268P). 

## How to run

1. `git clone git@github.com:maazadeeb/tsp-aco.git`
1. `cd tsp-aco`
1. Import it to your IDE of choice. IntelliJ IDEA is already setup here.
1. The `main` function is in the `ACORunner` class
1. It needs a VRP file of this [form](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/media/com_vrp/instances/A/A-n32-k5.vrp) from [http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/).
1. This input should be passed on from the `inputs` directory on the root folder. Example structure is `inputs/A-n32-k5.vrp`
